# Desiree Garcia

Iâ€™m a technical support professional with over a decade of experience in IT operations and customer service, currently pivoting into cybersecurity through hands-on federal experience. As an apprentice with the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Program at the Department of Homeland Security, Iâ€™ve gained practical training in asset management, threat detection, and risk assessmentâ€”all while holding an active Public Trust Clearance.

My background includes supporting enterprise IT environments, leading Tier 1 support teams, and contributing to mission-critical initiatives across both public and private sectors. Iâ€™ve worked remotely with high-impact organizations like Vercel and Apple support partners, consistently exceeding performance metrics and maintaining customer satisfaction scores above 90%.

In addition to my professional experience, I hold a B.S. in Information and Communication Technology with a concentration in Cyber Defense, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master of Information Technology at New Mexico State University. My technical toolkit includes tools like Wireshark and Kali Linux, development frameworks like React and Node.js, and certifications such as Security+ and Ciscoâ€™s CCNA: Introduction to Networks.

Driven by a passion for securing digital infrastructure and supporting national security, Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and making meaningful contributions in the federal cybersecurity space.
